# GPN8 Password Manager

### Background & Solution for the issue

At present, people who work with the new technology that is developing day by day have to use different software for different tasks. So people have to put different passwords for the security of data and information, as well as the security of their own works.

Here we have identified two main problems that people face.

   * With the amount of passwords people use today, it becomes difficult for people to manage them. 

   * Another one is that people want to use complex passwords for the security of their work, but it is difficult to create such complex passwords and it is difficult to remember those things.

As a solution to these problems, our team created this tool called ***“Password Manager”***. 
Simply say, you can create a complex password, encrypt it and save it through this tool.
